# Overview
Abelese is not just another music app; it's an immersive experience designed to bridge linguistic gaps and amplify the global accessibility of The Weeknd's soulful lyrics. Born out of a desire to connect with my cousin, who struggled to comprehend the poetic beauty of The Weeknd's songs due to a language barrier, Abelese seamlessly integrates technology to transcend borders.

## Inspiration
Abelese, a unique and immersive iOS application, was inspired by a simple desire to bridge language gaps in enjoying The Weeknd's music. The journey began when a cousin, unfamiliar with English, shared the love for The Weeknd's music but struggled to grasp the lyrics. This sparked the creation of Abelese, an app designed to provide a seamless experience by integrating The Weeknd's songs with real-time translations.

## Features
* Real-time Translation: Abelese utilizes Firebase and a REST API, integrating the LibreTranslate API to provide instant translation of The Weeknd's lyrics into over 30 languages. Users can immerse themselves in the essence of the songs, breaking down linguistic barriers effortlessly.
* Extensive Song Library: The app houses a Cloud Firestore database populated with a comprehensive collection of over 100 songs by The Weeknd, ensuring that fans can explore and connect with the artist's entire discography at their fingertips.
* MVVM Architecture: Built with Swift and SwiftUI, Abelese adheres to the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern, ensuring code organization and maintainability. This thoughtful approach enhances the app's performance and sets the stage for seamless future developments.

## How it's Built
Abelese is the result of meticulous development in Swift and SwiftUI, leveraging the power of Firebase for real-time updates and data storage. The Cloud Firestore database forms the backbone, housing an extensive collection of The Weeknd's songs. The integration of the LibreTranslate API allows users to dynamically translate lyrics, ensuring a personalized and inclusive experience.
